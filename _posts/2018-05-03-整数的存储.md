## 整数的存储

### signed vs. unsigned

unsigned int i=123;     //32bit
123转化为二进制为1111011
正数存原码

|  0   | 0    |0     |0     |0     |0     |0     |0     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     0| 0    |   0  |0     |   0  | 0    |  0   | 0    |
|     0|   0  | 0    |  0   | 0    |    0 |0     |   0  |
|   0  |     1|     1|     1|     1|     0|     1|  1   |


|  **123原码   ---   取反+1  ---   -123的补码**   |
| --- |

~~signed~~ int i=-123;      //32bit
第一位是符号位，1表示负号，0表示正号
后面31位是数据位
负数存补码


|   1  |1     |1     |1     | 1    |1     |1     |1     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   1  |1     |1     |1     | 1    |1     |1     | 1    |
|  1   |   1  | 1    | 1    | 1    |1     |1     |1     |
|   1  |    0 |  0   |   0  | 0    |  1   |   0  |   1 |


### 负数补码的求法

 1. 先确定其符号位为1；
 2. 求出其绝对值的原码：123
 
|  1   | 0    |0     |0     |0     |0     |0     |0     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     0| 0    |   0  |0     |   0  | 0    |  0   | 0    |
|     0|   0  | 0    |  0   | 0    |    0 |0     |   0  |
|   0  |     1|     1|     1|     1|     0|     1|  1   |

 3.对原码各位取反
 
 |   1  |1     |1     |1     | 1    |1     |1     |1     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   1  |1     |1     |1     | 1    |1     |1     | 1    |
|  1   |   1  | 1    | 1    | 1    |1     |1     |1     |
|   1  |    0 |  0   |   0  | 0    |  1   |   0  |   0  |
